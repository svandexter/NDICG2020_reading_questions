##week two
N50 is the weighted median contig size of a genome assembly.

##week three
#Ab initio gene prediction uses reference sequences to predict gene sequences.
#Evidence-based gene prediction uses phenotype data and comparative analysis to predict gene sequences.

##week four
#Alignment algorithms decrease the number of comparisons to be made by using short sequence words to set seeds instead of looping
#through all possible combinations.

##week six
#Fst is a measure of relatedness at a locus between populations, whereas Qst is specific to qualitative traits.

##week eleven
#Allele frequency is the proportion of a certain allele in a population.
#Genotype frequency is the proportion of an allele combination in a population.
#Phenotype frequency is the proportion of individuals exhibiting a trait in a population.
